You can hear me talk about things on a weekly basis if you tune into [The Bike
Shed], a technical discussion podcast I cohost with my friend [Sean Griffin].
I've also given the following prepared talks.

## Cultivating a Code Review Culture

Code reviews are not about catching bugs. Modern code reviews are about
socialization, learning, and teaching.

How can you get the most out of a peer's code review and how can you review code
without being seen as overly critical? Reviewing code and writing
easily-reviewed features are skills that will make you a better developer and a
better teammate.

I feel strongly that being a part of a strong code review culture continues to
make me a better developer each day. My goal with this talk is to give each of
you the tools to get more from the code reviews you receive and have more impact
with the reviews you leave for others, yielding your own strong code review
culture.
