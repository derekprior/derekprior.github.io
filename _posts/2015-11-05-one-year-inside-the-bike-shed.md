title: One Year Inside The Bike Shed
summary: |
  The Bike Shed isnâ€™t a show about Rails, JavaScript or any particular language
  or library. At its best, the Bike Shed is a show about the problems we face as
  developers and interesting ways we tackle them.

  On our first anniversary, I thought it would be interesting to look at the
  evolution and future of the show.
