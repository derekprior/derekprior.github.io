I have a thing for podcasts, first as a consumer but eventually as a host and
guest myself.

## The Bike Shed

  <p class="podcast-description">
    I was an original co-host of <a href="http://bikeshed.fm">The Bike Shed</a>,
    which is produced by thoughtbot. I was involved in all but a handful of the
    first 166 episodes before I left thoughtbot in July, 2018. Moving forward,
    I may appear as a guest host from time to time.
